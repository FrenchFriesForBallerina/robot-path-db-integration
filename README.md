# robot-path-db-integration

This project is a modular, scalable API being built with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy designed for logging and analyzing path and tuning parameters data from robotics systems.

## State of Project
Currently a work-in-progress, with features being added regularly. Once the API construction is finished, the next phase is integration to a robotics system to collect real-time data from sensors and analyse it. 

## Overview

The main goal of the project is to implement:

- efficient database interactions
- clean architecture
- dynamic configuration, 

thus making it suitable for data-driven robotics or other performance-optimization applications.
